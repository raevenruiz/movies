# Movies

Movies is a quick project that utlizes the basic components of SQL to create a table of movies.
I used PostgreSQL through the Postbird client for this project.

Project was developed through Codecademy:

## Contents
- `Movies Project.sql`: SQL file that contains my processes in building a movie database
- `films.csv`: resulting table after performing SQL queries
